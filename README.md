# JUnits coverage
This repository is tested with Junits. Coverage report can be found @ ~\target\Junit-report\index.html

# Static Code Analysis
This repository will be enforced to check static code bugs using findbugs. If there are any bugs found then the build breaks.

### Artifacts
1. Executable jar file: `.../weather-forecast/target/weather-forecast-${version}.jar`
1. Code coverage report: `.../weather-forecast/target/site/jacoco/index.html`
1. Findbugs report: `.../weather-forecast/target/findbugsXml.html`

### Approach

#H2 DB:
H2 is one of the popular in memory databases. Spring Boot has very good integration for H2. It is an in memory database. Its not a persisted database. So, data will be lost if application is restarted.

For this, we need to add the H2 runtime jar into dependencies

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
    <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>

When the application is ready, you can launch up H2 Console at http://localhost:8080/h2-console.
Make sure that you use jdbc:h2:./database/weatherForecastDB as JDBC URL as specified in application.properties.
